Site will be able to record audio from user's mic input to store onto a database to be re-accessed later.


HTML lacking:

*  `Popup page for signup button`
*  `Popupp page for upload button`
*  `Popupp page for signin button`

Feedback:
There probably doesn't need to be two titles for the website.  The second one says Echofly instead of Echofy (FIXED).  There's a lot of negative space around creators and clips(FIXED). To fix this, the clips right margin should be aligned under the creators so they match.  Other than that, it looks really good.

index.js:
Filled in some js using project 5 functions.  Need modals to finish.

index.html:
Changed some html titles.  We may need to give separate class name to the usernames in the clips container because if the modal searches text values, the images' html may be picked up by it.
